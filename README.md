# Connor_Stevens_simulation_v1
The NeuroTune Simulation Package (Version 1.0) provides an intuitive platform to explore the Connor-Stevens neuron model

# NeuroTune Simulation Package - Version 1.0
Description:
The NeuroTune Simulation Package provides a simplified implementation of the Connor-Stevens model of neuronal dynamics. It incorporates the key ion currents involved in action potential generation, focusing on Leak, Na⁺, K⁺, A-type K⁺, and T-type Ca²⁺ channels. This model does not include dynamic conductance changes and operates with static ion channel parameters, as described in Dayan & Abbott, Chapter 6.

Key Features:
•	Simulate action potentials based on the Connor-Stevens model.
•	Model components include Leak, Na⁺, K⁺, A-type K⁺, and T-type Ca²⁺ currents.
•	Simple interface to input initial conditions initial voltage, injected current,and total simulation time.
•	Visualize the simulation results in real time with interactive plotting.
•	Default parameters reproduce the example shown in Dayan & Abbott, Figure 6.2.

Usage:
1.	Define the initial conditions (initial voltage and injected current).
2.	Set the total simulation time and specify the timing of current injections.
3.	Click Run NeuroTune to simulate and visualize the action potential.
4.	The results are displayed on the built-in plotting interface.
